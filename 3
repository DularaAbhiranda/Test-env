Make sure to first copy the example files, and then rename them to probe.yaml
 
cp /etc/datadog-agent/system-probe.yaml.example /etc/datadog-agent/system-probe.yaml
vim /etc/datadog-agent/system-probe.yaml
 
These steps are mandatory: do not rename or edit the example file directly.
Instead, make a copy of the example file, rename it to probe.yaml, and apply your configurations there.
Always keep the original example file unchanged as a best practice.
