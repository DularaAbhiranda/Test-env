Solutions
1. Create and fix cache directories
bash# Create the cache directory that matches your config
sudo mkdir -p /var/spool/squid
sudo chown squid:squid /var/spool/squid
sudo chmod 750 /var/spool/squid

# Also create the standard cache directory (in case it's referenced elsewhere)
sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/squid
sudo chown squid:squid /var/cache/squid
sudo chmod 750 /var/cache/squid
2. Initialize the cache (without running instance)
Since you got the "already running" error, first ensure Squid is completely stopped:
bashsudo pkill -f squid
sudo rm -f /var/run/squid.pid
sudo squid -z
3. Fix log directory permissions
bashsudo mkdir -p /var/log/squid
sudo chown squid:squid /var/log/squid
sudo chmod 755 /var/log/squid
4. Create squid user if missing
bash# Check if squid user exists
id squid

# If not, create it:
sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin -d /var/spool/squid -c "Squid proxy" squid
5. Check detailed error logs
bashsudo journalctl -xeu squid.service
sudo tail -f /var/log/squid/cache.log
6. Test configuration
bashsudo squid -k parse
The main issue appears to be that while your build was successful, the runtime environment (directories, permissions, cache initialization) wasn't properly set up. The steps above should resolve the startup failures you're experiencing.
Try these fixes in order, and let me know what error messages you get from the journalctl command - that will show the specific startup failure reason.
